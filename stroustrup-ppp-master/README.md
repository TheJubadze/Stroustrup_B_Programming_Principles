## Current Status:
*June 25, 2018*
Initial pass through the book is complete. The final two chapters received less attention than others due to their content being covered through other resources, namely the study of [K & R](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1529961639&sr=1-1&keywords=the+c+programming+language) for learning C and daily use of [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for testing.

I'll now turn my attention to completing the quality assessment I had started in February. As of this writing I am completing work on the end of Part I - The Basics.

### Contributions
For anyone who is working through the textbook themselves and has questions about any particular exercise solution, either why something works or if you've found a bug I've missed, feel free to open an issue. I look forward to the opportunity for discussion.

## Hunt the Wumpus
At the end of chapter 18 we are tasked with implementing the classic game, Hunt the Wumpus. As I continue to evolve my solution I have moved it to a separate repository found [here](https://github.com/Chrinkus/wumpus).
